# My Personal Blog

Migrated my content (one post, ha!) from Gatsby to Astro. I'm using the [miniblog theme](https://github.com/nicholasdly/miniblog).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPO_NAME].git
cd [YOUR_REPO_NAME]
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Optionally, format your code after making changes:

```bash
npm run format
```
